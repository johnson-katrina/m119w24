```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We evaluate the function, square root of the quantity 3-x, at x=4.
```{r}
#h(x) = sqrt(3-x)
#h(-4)
sqrt(3-(-4))
```
We see the approximate value is 2.6. Note this is an approximate value of the square root of 7.

We evaluate the function $h(x) = \sqrt{3-x}$ at $x=-5$.
```{r}
h <- function(x){
  sqrt(3-x)
}
#sqrt(3-(5))
h(5)
```
The warning message in R reminds us to think about the domain of $h$. The domain of $h$ is $x \geq 3$. Since $-5 < 3$, we know that $h(-5)$ is undefined. Another way to say this is because -5 is not in the domain of $h$ we know there is no output of the function $h$ corresponding to an input of -5.
